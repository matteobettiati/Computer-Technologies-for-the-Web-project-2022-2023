# Description
A web application that allows the management of a playlist of music tracks. Playlists and tracks are personal to each user and not shared. Each music track is stored in the database with a title, image, album title from which the track is taken, the name of the performer (solo artist or group) of the album, the year of album publication, the music genre (assuming predefined genres), and the music file. The user, after logging in, can create tracks by uploading the relevant data and group them into playlists. A playlist is a collection of tracks chosen from those uploaded by the same user, sorted in descending order by the album's publication year. The same track can be included in multiple playlists. A playlist has a title and a creation date and is associated with its creator. Upon login, the user accesses the HOME PAGE, which displays a list of their playlists, sorted by descending creation date. It also includes a form for uploading a track with all the relevant data and a form for creating a new playlist. Creating a new playlist requires selecting one or more tracks to include. When the user clicks on a playlist in the HOME PAGE, the PLAYLIST PAGE appears, initially containing a table with one row and five columns. Each cell contains the title of a track and the album image it is from. The tracks are arranged from left to right in descending order of the album's publication date. If the playlist contains more than five tracks, commands are available to view the previous and next group of tracks. If the PLAYLIST PAGE displays the first group and there are subsequent groups in the ordering, a NEXT button appears to the right of the row, allowing the user to view the next group. If the PLAYLIST PAGE displays the last group and there are previous groups in the ordering, a PREVIOUS button appears to the left of the row, allowing the user to view the previous five tracks. If the PLAYLIST PAGE displays a block and both previous and next groups exist, a NEXT button appears to the right of the row, and a PREVIOUS button appears to the left. The PLAYLIST PAGE also includes a form that allows selecting and adding a track to the current playlist if it is not already present. After adding a track to the current playlist, the application displays the page again starting from the first block of the playlist. When the user selects the title of a track, the PLAYER PAGE shows all the data of the chosen track and an audio player for playing the track.
